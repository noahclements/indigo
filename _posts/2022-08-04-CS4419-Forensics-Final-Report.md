The goal of this final project was to analyze five memory dumps containing malicious activity and to come to a conclusion on what malware family it belonged to.
&nbsp;

This was my first forensics investigation using memory dumps and was an incredibly fun process digging through all the activity.
&nbsp;

Please note that my conclusions are just guesses based on my findings and may not be entirely accurate.
